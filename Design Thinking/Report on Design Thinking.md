## Introduction

   What is design thinking? Design thinking is a mindset and approach to problem-solving and innovation anchored around human-centred design. So it uses evidence of how consumers engage with a product or service, to be truly human-centred, designers watch how people use a certain product or service and continue to refine the product or service to improve the customer‚Äôs experience. It is based heavily on the methods and processes that designers use, but throughout time it has evolved from a range of different fields such as technology, engineering, architecture, education and business and it does not necessarily have to be design-specific. (Hasso Plattner, 2012) said that ‚Äúdesign thinking creates a vibrant interactive environment that promotes learning towards conceptual prototyping.‚Äù It favors moving quickly to get prototypes out to test, rather than endless research or rumination. Besides, design thinking is also a process which consists of 5 phases which are Empathise, Define, Idealate, Prototype and Test.

Through interviews, observations, and interactions, they gather insights into the users' experiences, frustrations, and desires. For a smart campus navigation app, empathising involves understanding students' struggles in finding buildings, locating resources, and managing their time efficiently |

Designers analyze data to create a clear, user-centric problem statement. For the smart campus app, defining might involve identifying specific pain points like the lack of real-time updates on event locations or the complexity of indoor navigation. |

Designers brainstorm without constraints, exploring a range of solutions that could address the identified problems. They aim to think innovatively, considering possibilities that may seem unconventional at first. For the app, ideation could involve brainstorming features such as augmented reality maps, personalized navigation, or integration with campus calendars |

Prototypes, ranging from sketches to interactive models, are created to visualize and communicate potential solutions. For the smart campus app, prototypes might include basic versions of the app interface, demonstrating functionalities like location tracking or event notifications. |

Designers gather feedback through user testing, observing how users interact with the prototypes. Insights collected during testing help evaluate the effectiveness of the solutions, highlighting areas for improvement. Testing the smart campus app would involve users navigating the campus using the prototype app, and providing feedback on its usability and effectiveness in addressing their navigation challenges. |
