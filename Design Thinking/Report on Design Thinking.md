## INTRODUCTION

   What is design thinking? Design thinking is a mindset and approach to problem-solving and innovation anchored around human-centred design. So it uses evidence of how consumers engage with a product or service, to be truly human-centred, designers watch how people use a certain product or service and continue to refine the product or service to improve the customer’s experience. It is based heavily on the methods and processes that designers use, but throughout time it has evolved from a range of different fields such as technology, engineering, architecture, education and business and it does not necessarily have to be design-specific. (Hasso Plattner, 2012) said that “design thinking creates a vibrant interactive environment that promotes learning towards conceptual prototyping.” It favors moving quickly to get prototypes out to test, rather than endless research or rumination. Besides, design thinking is also a process which consists of 5 phases which are Empathise, Define, Idealate, Prototype and Test.

## DETAIL DESCRIPTIONS
### **1.0 PROBLEMS**

   Interviewing students and teachers at UTM about their daily campus experiences initiated our design thinking project. This allowed us to uncover a multitude of challenges they face, from navigating the campus complexities to coping with lecture disruptions and transportation issues. After gathering this comprehensive understanding of their concerns, we delved deeper into discussions, exploring potential solutions to tackle these challenges effectively. Therefore, we listed down the problems as below:

**Large and complex UTM campus**

   The sprawling and intricate UTM campus poses a significant challenge for students, especially newcomers. Finding event locations, specifically determining the floors where events occur, remains a common struggle. Additionally, there's a lack of awareness among students about programs exclusively held within their college area, making it harder to access relevant events and activities.

**Daily lectures are not going smoothly for students**

   Daily lectures face disruptions, primarily due to last-minute venue changes initiated by some lecturers. This unpredictability causes students to struggle in finding the new venues swiftly, resulting in potential lateness or missed sessions due to the time-consuming search for relocated classes.

**Long waiting times for buses at designated stops**

   Students encounter prolonged waiting times at designated bus stops. Navigating the bus schedule proves challenging, leading to uncertainty about the optimal time to be at the stop for a direct bus arrival. This inefficiency in transportation affects their punctuality and overall schedule.

**Safety and Emergency Concerns**

   The campus might lack proper disclosure of security issues or emergency procedures. To address this, an app is proposed to guide users to the nearest safe exit points during emergencies. This feature aims to swiftly navigate individuals away from potential danger and facilitate an organized response to emergencies.

**QR attendance for students can be time-consuming and prone to cheating**
           
   The QR code attendance system presents time-consuming challenges for students. There's a high potential for cheating attendance by obtaining codes without attending classes. Moreover, technical errors in phones can further hinder the process, adding to the time consumption and creating an unfair advantage for some students.


### **2.0 SOLUTIONS**

   After identifying the challenges faced on campus, our group engaged in a collaborative brainstorming session. We decided to create a smart navigation app tailored to our campus needs. Here are our solution to meet the needs of students and teachers in UTM campus:	

**Large and Complex Campus Navigation**

   We implement a detailed campus map within the app, integrating GPS technology for real-time location tracking. Besides, we also provide step-by-step navigation, highlighting the most efficient routes to different buildings and classrooms. Augmented reality features can also enhance navigation by overlaying directional information on the user's device camera view. 
 
**Efficient Lecture Navigation**

   We include a class schedule feature in the app, allowing students to input their course timetable. The app can then provide optimized routes to their next lecture or class, considering their current location and class schedule. Integration with the campus map ensures accurate navigation. 
 
**Real-time Bus Tracking System**

   We implement a real-time bus tracking system within the app. Students can view the current location of buses, estimated arrival times at specific stops, and any delays. They can also view the traffic jams or any busy regions by using the app. This information helps students plan their departure times effectively, minimizing wait times at bus stops.
 
**Emergency Communication**

   We integrate an emergency alert system into the app. In case of emergencies or security concerns, push notifications can be sent to all app users with relevant information and instructions. Additionally, we also include an emergency contact feature for quick access to campus security or emergency services. 
 
**GPS Location-Based Attendance**

   We revolutionize attendance management by employing GPS technology. Students check in by being physically present at the designated class location. This innovative approach aims to prevent cheating, ensuring students' actual presence is required for attendance recording. Professors can easily monitor attendance based on real-time GPS location, eliminating the potential for manipulation seen in QR code attendance systems.


### **3.0 TEAM WORKING**

   Starting off our project, teamwork was essential. We elected Nurin as our team leader to organize tasks based on everyone's skills and preferences. Splitting the project into five phases of the design thinking process, we made sure to keep talking, tweaking our work together, and making improvements as a team throughout.

   Wei Cheng handled the Empathize and Define phases. He led interviews, crafted detailed questionnaires, and made sure to gather all the data we needed. We recorded these interviews on Google Meet to make sure we didn't miss a thing.

   Moving on to the Ideate phase, Ming Kuang took the reins. We brainstormed under his guidance, throwing ideas around, solving problems, and deciding what features to put into our prototype.

   Nurin was in charge of the Prototype phase. Using Canva, she made sure our prototype looked good and was easy to use. She paid close attention to the team's feedback, ensuring our prototype met the users' needs.

   Khan managed the Test phase, where we let users try out the prototype. He collected their feedback and suggestions, and together, we worked on improving our prototype based on what we learned.

   Additionally, alongside these phases, we collectively handled the written report, ensuring it aligned with the tasks assigned to each phase. Even though we each had our specific roles, we always jumped in to help each other. It was clear that doing it all alone wasn't feasible. We faced some challenges along the way, but with hard work and Nurin's leadership, we successfully completed our design thinking project. Our teamwork, constant communication, and willingness to support one another were the keys to our achievement.
