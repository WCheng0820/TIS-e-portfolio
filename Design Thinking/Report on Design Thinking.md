## Introduction

   What is design thinking? Design thinking is a mindset and approach to problem-solving and innovation anchored around human-centred design. So it uses evidence of how consumers engage with a product or service, to be truly human-centred, designers watch how people use a certain product or service and continue to refine the product or service to improve the customer‚Äôs experience. It is based heavily on the methods and processes that designers use, but throughout time it has evolved from a range of different fields such as technology, engineering, architecture, education and business and it does not necessarily have to be design-specific. (Hasso Plattner, 2012) said that ‚Äúdesign thinking creates a vibrant interactive environment that promotes learning towards conceptual prototyping.‚Äù It favors moving quickly to get prototypes out to test, rather than endless research or rumination. Besides, design thinking is also a process which consists of 5 phases which are Empathise, Define, Idealate, Prototype and Test.

Through interviews, observations, and interactions, they gather insights into the users' experiences, frustrations, and desires. For a smart campus navigation app, empathising involves understanding students' struggles in finding buildings, locating resources, and managing their time efficiently |
